# Description

Wib is an idea based on a Weather Oracle of Chainlink. It allows users to purchase insurance at a place at any time (as long as 10 days after the current date). Perfect for event organizers who want to buy insurance for their events. All operations will be performed automatically via smart contract. From creating a contract, to checking insurance conditions and paying damages. No more thinking about cheating as human-operated systems.

# Main features:

- Create a new insurance contract
- See all user insurance packages purchased
- Check compensation conditions
- Receive payment for damages
